## Overview

[Voting Rights Code](https://github.com/Voting-Rights-Code) is currently a group of friends and volunteers building, maintaining and using a tool to measure inequities in pollig locations, as well as make legally compliant suggestions to counties and advocacy organization of where to place additional polling locations to best improve access. (See our [Equitable Polling Locations Tool](https://github.com/Voting-Rights-Code/Equitable-Polling-Locations)). Over the past year of our existence, we have providied analysis for 18 counties for parterns such as [Fair Fight Action](https://fairfight.com/),  [Campaign Legal Center](https://campaignlegal.org/), [Virginia Civic Engagement Table](https://engageva.org/) and Madison, Wi. When we started, we had never dreamed that we could be so successful on so few resources.

When we started, we had no idea how much interest, and work, our tool would generate. 

We cannot sustain our contributions to the field a small group of volunteers any longer. We are looking for a quotes for fundraising services to help us grow.

## Scope of work

* Identify the a list of potential donor and grant sources. 
* Work with current team to develop a fundraising plan that meets current growth goals
* Implement said plan, with help from volunteers as as appropriate.

## The selected fundraiser shall:

* Review the groups current growth and fundraising goals and timelines
* Provide input to the goals based on knowledge of the current funder landscape and personal experience
* Conduct research into the current, near and medium term opportunities
* Develop a fundraising plan that responds to the current donor and funding agency resources and the group's goals.
* Raise money for the organization.

## Qualified bidders must meet the following criteria:

* Have a minimum of 5 years of fundraising experience in the voting rights, civic tech or similar space.
  *  Or have a demonstrated portfolio of fundraising successes for similar organizations
* Be able to work with a team of dedicated volunteers who all have day jobs in other fields. This includes:
  * Working independently with little supervision. (We may not be able to respond to an email until after the buisiness day is over)
  * Excellent communication skills. (When time is the most constraining resource, clear, timely communication of both asks and emotional needs is crucial)
  * The ability to work around our schedules. (Meetings and emails may have to happen outside of standard business hours, depending on your time zone.)
* Experience helping with new organizations get off the ground. 

## Budget Constraint:

Negotiable percentage of funds brought in. 
As this position is to find seed funding for the the group, we are unable to give a budget for billable hours. However, we are open to budgeting for a successful fundraiser moving forward. 

## Submissio Process:
Interseted parties are invited to submit proposals by email to susama@alum.mit.edu. Submissions should contain a resume and a cover letter. A list of past successful fundraising activities should be clearly indicated in one or the other. Quotes will be considered on a rolling basis.

Thank you for your interest in helping Voting Rights Code grow from a group of volunteers into a fully fledged organization that can meet the apparent demand for our services.
