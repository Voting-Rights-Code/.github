# Voting Rights Code

### Who we are
A group of friends with highly techinical backgrounds who woke up one day thinking _"If not us, then who?"_

We are an all volunteer organization working on this project in the hours between earning our living, parenting, taking care of our pets and sleeping.

* Chad Rosenberg is a game designer, data engineer, CTO and project manager. He started his career managing academic code bases for labs that became startups.  
* Daphne Skipper is an erstwhile Georgian and a mathematics professor at the US Naval Academy. The model behind our equitable poll placement tool is her work. 
* Susama Agarwala is currently a data scientist who dislikes working with people who _just care sooo much_. Since she is not brave enough (read too financially conservative) to start her own buisiness, she writes code for the people she admires. In her spare time, she trains her dog, publishes mathematical physics papers and worries about how to raise her son to be proud of his heritage in the country he is inheriting.

### What we do
Write code and run analysis for civil liberties advocacy organizations to help make the US voting system a little bit more fair. 

**What we do NOT do**

We are not a group of technitions who think we know how to fix the system.

* The advocacy groups have been in the field for decade and have crucial degrees in law and the social sciences.
  * They set the vision
  * We are proud to be able to support them.
